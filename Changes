Revision history for Perl extension Ctype.

0.02  Sun May 01 06:15:10 2005
	- I've finally got around to updating Ctype.  Sorry for the long wait, but I think I spent too much time
	  concentrating on other projects.  
	- Added a META.yml.  (I didn't really do it, Mr. MakeMaker did it ;-)
	- Updated MANIFEST (ditto, oh how much I love updates of Perl)
	- Warned that isXDIGIT is deprecated because it is not offically part of libperl.  
	- Changed license.  
	- And finally updated $VERSION ;-).
