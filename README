Ctype version 0.01
==================

Ctype is a module that provides character classification.  It has a 
plain interface (accesible through the functions with the same names as 
the ones in the C library) and an OO interface.

small, it serves as a good example of how to make an XS/Perl module with 
OO/regular interfaces.
